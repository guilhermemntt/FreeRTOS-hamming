# FreeRTOS-hamming

This project presents a solution in order to ensure FreeRTOS stack's data integrity by providing a secure context switch. To reach the result it was used a ATmega328P microprocessor and custom Hamming and CRC-16-CCITT algorithms, developed at Atmel Studio 7.0.1645 IDE. The main purpose is make a minimum set of modifications at the FreeRTOS code to garantee the smoothest fit into a user's personal project.
